# Complexity / Speed

My solution for part 2 is O(n^3). I can see a way to get O(n^2) with further optimization.
However, for the number of inputs, its pretty small.

# Extensiblity

Its pretty easy to make a recursive solution from the part 2 solution, with the part 1 solution
as the base case. This allows it to be extended quite easily to an arbitrary number.
